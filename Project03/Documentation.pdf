Sentiment Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a dataset containing tweets. The goal is to
classify tweets into different sentiment categories using machine learning techniques.
Data Source
The data used in this project comes from Kaggle, comprising training and test datasets for sentiment
analysis.
Data Processing
- Data Loading: The datasets were loaded using Pandas, and missing values were checked.
- Data Cleaning: Rows with missing values were removed from both training and test datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sentiment Distribution by Time of Tweet: A count plot was created to visualize the distribution of
sentiments over different times of the day.
- Sentiment Distribution by Age of User: A bar plot was used to show the distribution of sentiments
across different age groups of users.
Feature Engineering
- Text Data: Text data was tokenized and converted into sequences.
- Categorical Data: Categorical features such as 'Time of Tweet', 'Age of User', and 'Country' were
one-hot encoded.
- Numerical Data: Numerical features like 'Population -2020', 'Land Area (Km²)', and 'Density
(P/Km²)' were normalized using a standard scaler.

Model Training
A neural network model was trained using the processed features:
- Text data sequences
- One-hot encoded categorical data
- Normalized numerical data
Predictions
A function was created to preprocess the test data and make predictions using the trained model.
This function handles missing data appropriately, prepares text, categorical, and numerical inputs,
and generates sentiment predictions.
Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using a classification report, comparing the predicted
labels against the actual labels.
